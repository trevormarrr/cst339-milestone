### Weekly Team Status Summary (UseCase)
![Usercase](usercase.png)
- This week, we used Spring Security to design and secure the REST API.  We developed APIs that enable users to retrieve a particular product by ID or all items.  Because these endpoints are protected, accessing them requires that the user be logged in using HTTP Basic Authentication.  An unlawful response will be displayed, for instance, if someone attempts to access the /products or /products/{id} endpoint without first logging in.  A legitimate user will be able to view the product info as anticipated after logging in.  To make sure everything functions properly, we additionally tested the API using Postman and other tools.


### GIT URL
- The git URL that can be used to clone your code and design artifacts

### Screencast URL:
- The URL that can be used to access your screencast demonstration video for the respective assignment
**screencast*

### Peer Review:
- [x]  We acknowledge that our team has reviewed this Report and we agree to the approach we are all taking


## Planning Documentation
### Initial Planning:
- For Milestone 7, We concentrated on developing and safeguarding the REST API for our seventh milestone. Implementing endpoints to return all items and a particular product by ID was our aim. We used Spring Security with simple HTTP authentication to secure these APIs.
* Reviewing requirements, creating the Swagger APIs, and tying authentication to the database were all part of the planning process. Important duties included:
* Establishing endpoints for /products and /products/{id}
* Using database authentication and Spring Security to secure APIs
* Handling invalid or illegal requests
* Adding API information to the Design Report



### Retrospective Results:
The following table should be completed after each Retrospective on things that went well (keep doing)

| What Went Well |
| -------------- |
|Our REST APIs were successfully configured and secured with Spring Security and simple HTTP authentication.|
|We used our planning documents to keep on task and communicated clearly as a team.|
|Code reviews guaranteed consistent documentation and comments and assisted us in identifying minor bugs early.|

The following table should be completed after each Retrospective on things that didnâ€™t go well (stop doing) and what would be done differently next time with an action plan to improve (try doing and continuous improvement)

| What Did Not Go Well | Action Plan | Due Date  |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| N/A | N/A  | April 20 |


## Design Documentation
### Install Instruction
- Software Requirements:
  - IDE: Visual Studio Code(make sure it's installed for editing project report & running project)
  - Database: MySql Server (make sure it's installed & running)
  - Java Development Kit (JDK) Version 11 or higher (make sure it's properly installed)

  - Steps:
    - Have main class to run milestone
    - Create Models for login, registration, & books
    - Create html classes for login, registration, index, dashboard, & error(preferable)
    - Create Controllers for login, registration, & main pages
    - Create registration service class for future milestone
    - Add logo
    - Add CSS to site

### General Technical Approach:
Add data here.
- The App needs:
  - a database of books.
  - the same database of users with user info
    - Two different types of users:
      - Admins have access to CRUD operations.
      - Customers have access to view the inventory, adding and removing from the book bag, and to checkout.

### Key Technical Design Decisions:
- Spring Boot: Spring tools help Java development effiecency. 
- MySQL: To manage databases
- Postman: enviornment for API development

### Known Issues:
Any anomalies or known issues in the code or functionality should be documented here


### Risks:
- **Time Constraints:** Balancing the project timeline alongside other academic responsibilities could be challenging. Unforeseen issues may increase the risk of missing deadlines.  
- **Team Collaboration:** Ineffective communication or coordination within the team could lead to delays in integration and slower progress.  
- **Database Integration:** Integrating the database into the project presents potential challenges, including schema design issues or compatibility problems with the relational database.  
- **Learning Curve:** As the project relies on gradually learning and applying Spring Boot features, unfamiliarity with the framework could lead to difficulties in handling errors, setting up CRUD operations, and ensuring smooth implementation.

  "message": "User successfully registered",
  "userId": 1
}
```

## Error Responses

All error responses follow this JSON format:

**Response**  
```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "You are not allowed to perform this action"
}
```


### Security Design:

1. **Authentication Mechanism**

   - **Flow**  
     After a user types in their credentials, the system will verify them against the database and then grant an auth token.

   - **Credential Storage**  
     Credentials will be stored in the database and passwords will be hashed for encryption.

   - **Password Requirements**  
     - One uppercase letter
     - One lowercase letter
     - One special character  
     - One number

2. **Authorization Mechanism**
   - **Role-Based Access Control(RBAC)**  
     - Admin 
        - Create New Book
        - Update Book
        - Delete Book
        - View Inventory 
        - Login 
        - Register
     - User
        - View Books
        - Login
        - Register

3. **Security Features**
    - **Encryption**  
        - Password will be hashed before stored into database and data will be encrypted during transit using HTTPS
    - **RBAC**  
        - Users will be restricted specific actions whereas Admins will have the ability to do everything. 
     
### Other Documentation:
You should insert any additional drawings, storyboards, whiteboard pictures, project schedules, tasks lists, etc. that support your approach, design, and project. If you have no supporting documentation, please explain the rationale for why you are able to leave this section as N/A
